# Project-2-WOCO

Our application allows the user to choose from several surveys: friendship, mentorship and to find a date. After the user completes the survey it outputs the name of the person and their image of their best match. Also, it offers resources and links to networking. In the dating site, the user is able to rate their date and provide additional information about how their date was for other women to view.
